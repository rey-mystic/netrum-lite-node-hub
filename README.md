## 📁 Folder Structure
```
netrum-lite-node-hub/
├─ bot.js
├─ .env
├─ package.json
├─ package-lock.json
└─ reset-commands.js
```
---
## ⚙️ Setup
> ⚠️ Running directly on Windows PowerShell/CMD is not supported because some commands and paths are Linux-specific. Use WSL or a Linux VPS.
```
sudo su
```
### 2. Clone this repository
```
sudo git clone https://github.com/rey-mystic/netrum-lite-node-hub.git
cd netrum-lite-node-hub
```
### 3. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
### 4. Configure `.env`

Create a `.env` file in your bot directory:
```
# Discord Bot Configuration
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
CLIENT_ID=your_discord_app_id

# Replace with the Discord channel ID where the bot is allowed to respond
ALLOWED_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_ID

# Path to the netrum binary
NETRUM_PATH=$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.4/bin/netrum
# Or if installed globally:
# NETRUM_PATH=/usr/local/bin/netrum

# Path to mining log file
MINING_LOG_PATH=$HOME/netrum-lite-node-hub/logs/mining.log
```
> - Basically, both `NETRUM_PATH` and `MINING_LOG_PATH` depend on where you installed the Netrum Lite Node and where the mining log is being written.  
> - `$HOME` will automatically adjust: `/root` if running as the root user. `/home/username` if running as a regular user (e.g., ubuntu, rey, etc.)   
> - It's okay, don't change `$HOME` in `.env`. If occuring an error, do with your own research! 

For `NETRUM_PATH`:  
Must point to the netrum binary.
To find it, run:
```
which netrum
```
or
```
whereis netrum
```
After you find it, Copy that path into `.env`

For `MINING_LOG_PATH`:  
Must point to the log file generated by your miner.
To generate it, run miner with logging (Linux/WSL/VPS):  
```
mkdir -p ~/netrum-lite-node-hub/logs
nohup node ./src/system/mining/live-log.js >> ~/netrum-lite-node-hub/logs/mining.log 2>&1 &
```
This will keep miner running in background and write logs to ~/netrum-lite-node-hub/logs/mining.log.   

### 5. Make a Discord Server & Bot
#### Create a Discord Server
- Open [Discord](https://discord.com/) and log in.
- On the left sidebar, click the **+** (Add Server).
- Select **Create My Own**.
- Give your server a name, for example: `Netrum Lite Node Hub`.
- Click **Create** → your server is now ready.
#### Create a Bot Application
- Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- Click **New Application**, choose a name (e.g. `NetrumHubBot`), then click **Create**.
- Go to the **Bot** tab → Reset Token → Copy the **Bot Token** (you’ll use this for `DISCORD_TOKEN` in your `.env` file).
- Go to **General Information** tab → Copy the **Application ID** (you’ll use this for `CLIENT_ID` in your `.env` file).
   > ⚠️ **Never share your bot token publicly.**
#### Set Bot Permissions
- In the bot application settings, open **OAuth2 URL Generator**.
- Check:
   - **Scopes:** `bot` and `applications.commands`
   - **Bot Permissions:** select `Send Messages`, `Read Messages/View Channels`, `Use Slash Commands`
- Copy the generated invite link, open it in your browser address bar, and select the server you just created.
- Click **Authorize** → your bot is now added to the server!
---
## 🕹️ Usage
### Run the bot with:
```
node bot.js
```
### Reset commands:
>⚠️ Do not perform this step if everything is already working.   
>This is only a precaution in case you need to reset the commands after modifying them in `bot.js`   
>Perform a reset if the command or text changes are not reflected in Discord.   
```
node reset-commands.js
```
### Once the bot is online, use slash commands in Discord:

`/status` → check if node is running  
`/wallet` → view wallet balance and address  
`/claim` → claim preview  
`/claim yes` → claim NPT directly  
`/mining-log` → view last 10 lines of mining log
